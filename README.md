# Quantitative User Research using NLP Techniques

This was a pilot study of 3 test subjects. Sampling size is too small to draw statistically valid conclusions.
Test was conducted with an interactive prototype following a script as read by a moderator and following a talk-aloud protocol. Test sessions were recorded and annotated using notes and hashtags
